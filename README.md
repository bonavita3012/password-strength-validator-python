# Requirements

-The file must be located in the same directory as the script
-Each line in the file represents a commonly used weak password
-The script will not run correctly if the file is missing or renamed
# password-strength-validator
Password Strength validator built in python. 
This project implements a password strength analyzer focused on security fundamentals. 
It validates passwords based on length, character diversity (uppercase,lowercase,numbers, and special characters)
and detects weak patterns commonly used in compromised credentials. 
The goal is to demonstrate practical python usage applied to cybersecurity concepts such as 
weak password detection, rule-based validation, and input handling. 
This project was designed to be modular, readable, and easily extensible for future improvements 
like breached-password lists, entropy calculation, or API integration.
